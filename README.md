## 🌟 About This Repository
This repository is a reflection of my **learning journey in VLSI & ASIC design** through the  
**RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program (VSD & IIT)**.  

I’ve always been curious about how chips are built — from RTL to final silicon.  
Being part of India’s **semiconductor movement** is a big motivation for me, and I’m eager to explore  
open-source tools and contribute to this ecosystem.
